# üß≠ User Manual ‚Äì Internship Work Repository

## üìò Overview

This repository serves as a record of all the work completed during an internship at **BCAM (Basque Center for Applied Mathematics)**.  
It documents the progress, methodologies, and results developed across multiple analytical and computational tasks.

Rather than covering introductory explanations or theoretical background, the focus lies on **specific analyses, visualizations, and applications** performed during the internship.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

| Folder / File | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Context** | Provides the initial context of the analyses. |
| **Resources and References** | Contains information about the packages and libraries used, including links to their documentation. |
| **Visibility Graph and 2D/3D Embedding** | Includes notebooks related to visibility graph construction and 2D/3D embeddings. |
| **UMAP and Histplot** | Focused on Shapelet analysis and visualization. |
| **Shapelets** | Presents ‚Äúclustering‚Äù representations of bursts using UMAP and histograms. |
| **Better UMAP Identification** | Refined clustering and UMAP analysis for conflictive burst areas *(in progress)*. |
| **Applications for Burst Identification and Evaluation** | Tools to compare anomalous bursts with their surroundings, allowing both quantitative and visual analysis. |
| **Python Related Content** | Python scripts, CSV files, and `.abf` datasets used across tasks. |
| **Images of Projects/Tasks** | Visual outputs of each project or task (stored in 4 folders ‚Äî one per project). |

Subfolders for images:
- `Task1_images/`
- `Task2_images/`
- `Task3_images/`
- `Task4_images/`
- `Task5_images/`

## üñºÔ∏è Outputs

Each task or project includes:
- Generated **plots and figures** (stored in `TaskX_images/`)
- **Processed CSV files** with analysis results
- **Python scripts** implementing specific methods
- **ABF files** representing electrophysiological data inputs

---

## üß© Notes

- Not all image outputs are visible within the `.ipynb` preview on GitHub; the dedicated image folders ensure full access.
- Some parts of the analysis (e.g., ‚ÄúBetter UMAP identification‚Äù) are **ongoing work**.
