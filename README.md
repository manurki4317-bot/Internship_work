# Internship work
This repository serves as a record of all the work I completed during my internship at BCAM (Basque Center for Applied Mathematics).

**Repository structure:**  
The repository is designed as a log of my progress throughout the internship. Rather than providing introductory explanations of basic concepts, it focuses directly on the specific topics, analyses, and results that I worked on. This makes it a useful reference both for myself and for anyone interested in following the steps of the developed tasks.


- **[Tasks/proyects done](./task)**: Main notebooks of the projects.
  - **[Context](./task/1_context.md)**: Initial context of the analysis.
  - **[Resources and references](./task/2_Libraries_used.md)**
  - **[Visibility graph and 2D and 3D embedding.ipynb](./task/2_Visibility_embedding_graph.ipynb)**: Visibility graphs and embeddings.
  - **[Shapelets.ipynb](./task/3_Shapelets.ipynb)**: Shapelets analysis.
  - **[UMAP and Histplot.ipynb](./task/4_histplot.ipynb)**: "Clustering" representation of bursts with UMAP and histogram with bursts.
- **[Python related content](.python)**: Codes, csv's, and abf's used for the tasks.
  - **[bursts .abf's](./python/bursting)**: abf files with the data to be studied.
  - **[tasks codes](./python/codes)**: Python codes done for each task. Tthe best way to understand the codes is to download them and to create a new .py or .ipynb and interact there with the code and its explanations.
  - **[csv's](./python/csv)**: Files with data in CSV format.
- **[Images of each of the projects/tasks](./Images_outputs)**: Images of the projects/tasks done (it was not possible to make them visible in .ipynb documents, so they have been stored in 4 files, each one corrresponfing to a project).
  - **[Task1 images](./Images_outputs/Task1)** 
  - **[Task2 images](./Images_outputs/Task2)**
  - **[Task3 images](./Images_outputs/Task3)**
  - **[Task4 images](./Images_outputs/Task4)**
