# Internship work
This repository serves as a record of all the work I completed during my internship at BCAM (Basque Center for Applied Mathematics).

**Repository structure:**  
The repository is designed as a log of my progress throughout the internship. Rather than providing introductory explanations of basic concepts, it focuses directly on the specific topics, analyses, and results that I worked on. This makes it a useful reference both for myself and for anyone interested in following the steps of the developed tasks.

- **[User manual](./user_manual)** User manual

- **[Tasks/proyects done](./task)**: Main notebooks of the projects.
  - **[Context](./task/1_context.md)**: Initial context of the analysis.
  - **[Resources and references](./task/2_Libraries_used.md)** Packages and libraries used. There are links to access to the information related to each library used.
  - **[Visibility graph and 2D and 3D embedding](./task/Task1.ipynb)**: Visibility graphs and embeddings.
  - **[UMAP and Histplot](./task/Task2.ipynb)**: Shapelets analysis.
  - **[Shapelets](./task/Task3.ipynb)**: "Clustering" representation of bursts with UMAP and histogram with bursts.
  - **[Better UMAP identification](./task/Task4.ipynb):** A better"Clustering" representation of bursts with UMAP analysing "conflictive bursts areas" (still in progress).
  - **[Applications for bursts identification and evaluation](./task/Task5.ipynb):** It compares "anomalous bursts" with burst from their surroundings, permitting also to analyse it visually.
  - **[Burst segmentation, feature extraction, and visualization](./task/Task6.ipynb)** It loads electrophysiology recordings, detects spikes and bursts, segments traces into burst types, extracts waveform features, reduces dimensionality using UMAP, and visualizes the results through static and interactive plots.

    
- **[Python related content](.python)**: Codes, csv's, and abf's used for the tasks.
  - **[bursts .abf's](./python/bursting)**: abf files with the data to be studied.
  - **[tasks codes](./python/codes)**: Python codes done for each task.
  - **[csv's](./python/csv)**: Files with data in CSV format.
- **[Images of each of the projects/tasks](./Images_outputs)**: Images of the projects/tasks done. They have been stored in 6 folders, each one corrresponfing to a project.
  - **[Task1 images](./Images_outputs/Task1)** 
  - **[Task2 images](./Images_outputs/Task2)**
  - **[Task3 images](./Images_outputs/Task3)**
  - **[Task4 images](./Images_outputs/Task4)**
  - **[Task5 images](./Images_outputs/Task5)**
  - **[Task6 images](./Images_outputs/Task6)**
