    "# Comprehensive Spike and Burst Analysis with Visibility Graphs\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed workflow for analyzing electrophysiological ABF recordings. It goes through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading ABF files and concatenating sweeps\n",
    "- Spike detection\n",
    "- Burst detection\n",
    "- Burst classification\n",
    "- Saving bursts to CSV\n",
    "- Visibility graph creation for each burst\n",
    "- 2D and 3D embeddings of the burst graphs\n",
    "- Visualization of spikes, bursts, and graphs\n",
    "- Saving nodes and edges data to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section includes detailed explanations of the code functionality and rationale behind each step."
