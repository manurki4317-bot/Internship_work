    "# Spike and Burst Analysis with ABF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo shares some practice sessions on analyzing electrophysiology signals from **ABF (Axon Binary File)** recordings. The main focus is spotting *spikes* and *bursts*, pulling out key metrics, and visualizing patterns with tools like **UMAP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you can do\n",
    "- Detect action potentials (*spikes*).\n",
    "- Find burst patterns (*bursts*).\n",
    "- Calculate simple stats (mean, ISI, area under curve, etc.).\n",
    "- Classify activity by shape and timing.\n",
    "- Explore conditions in low-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why intracranial data?\n",
    "Compared to M/EEG (non-invasive but noisy), intracranial recordings give cleaner, higher-res signals. That makes it possible to look at single spikes and their bursts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "- `pyabf` for reading `.abf` files\n",
    "- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy` for math/stats\n",
    "- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` for plots\n",
    "- `umap-learn`, `scikit-learn` for dimension reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Use a **virtual environment (conda/venv)** so dependencies don‚Äôt clash.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repo goals\n",
    "1. A reproducible pipeline for ABF analysis.\n",
    "2. Document the workflow from practice sessions.\n",
    "3. Base for future neuro data projects.\n",
