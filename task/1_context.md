# Spike and Burst Analysis with ABF Files

This repository focuses on visualizing and briefly explaining different methods to detect "bursts", classify them, and explore effective techniques to find patterns and properties that can improve their identification in the future.


## What has been done in the projects/tasks
- Detect action potentials (*spikes*).  
- Find burst patterns (*bursts*).  
- Calculate basic stats (mean, ISI, area under curve, etc.).  
- Classify activity by shape and timing.  
- Explore conditions in reduced dimensions, among others

## Tools
- `pyabf`: read `.abf` files  
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`: math & stats  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`: plots  
- `umap-learn`, `scikit-learn`: dimensionality reduction
