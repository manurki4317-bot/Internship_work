# 1. Resources and references

I’ve put together some resources and references using Python. These are the main libraries that supported my analyses, computations, and visualizations in the tasks/projects done during the internship.


**· Core numerical and scientific computing:**

NumPy – Fundamental library for numerical computing, arrays, and linear algebra.

SciPy – Scientific computing, including signal processing (find_peaks, hilbert) and interpolation (interp1d).

os – Provides a way of interacting with the operating system.

**Data handling and manipulation:**

pandas – Data structures and analysis tools (DataFrame, Series).

tslearn – Time-series machine learning, including preprocessing (TimeSeriesScalerMinMax) and shapelets learning (LearningShapelets).

**Statistics and metrics:**

scipy.stats – Provides statistical functions such as skew and kurtosis.

numpy.linalg – Linear algebra operations, e.g. least squares (lstsq).

scikit-learn (sklearn) – Tools for machine learning and model evaluation:

  TruncatedSVD for dimensionality reduction.

  StandardScaler for feature scaling.

  r2_score for model evaluation.

**Signal processing and electrophysiology**

pyABF – Specialized library to read and analyze Axon Binary Files (ABF) from electrophysiology experiments.

**Machine learning and dimensionality reduction**

UMAP – Dimensionality reduction and visualization technique.

TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning framework (used here with the Adam optimizer).

**Graphs and network analysis**

networkx – Creation, analysis, and visualization of complex networks/graphs.

**Plotting and visualization**

matplotlib – Standard Python plotting library.

matplotlib.cm – Colormap handling for visualizations.

seaborn – High-level statistical data visualization built on matplotlib.

plotly.express – Interactive plotting library.

plotly.io – Lower-level interface for rendering plotly figures.

**Jupyter utilities**

%matplotlib widget – Enables interactive plots within Jupyter notebooks.
